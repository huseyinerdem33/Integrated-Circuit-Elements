Pin No	Name	Function

1	GND	Ground (0V) connection

2	TRIG	Trigger input (initiates a pulse)

3	OUT	Output (connect your load here)

4	RESET	Active-low reset input (usually tied to VCC)

5	CTRL	Control voltage (usually filtered by a capacitor)

6	THRS	Threshold input (monitors capacitor voltage)

7	DISCH	Discharge pin (discharges capacitor)

8	VCC	Supply voltage (typically 5V or 9V)


⚙️ Operating Modes

1. Monostable Mode (One-shot Mode)
Triggered by a push button.

Output goes HIGH for a fixed period of time.

Applications: Timer, button debouncing, doorbell circuits, etc.

2. Astable Mode (Free-running Mode)

Continuously switches between HIGH and LOW.

Generates square waves.

Applications: Blinking LEDs, tone generators, PWM signals, etc.

3. Bistable Mode (Flip-Flop Mode)
   
Acts like a flip-flop controlled by TRIG and RESET.

Applications: Digital switches, memory circuits.

⚡ Advantages

Very easy to use

Inexpensive and widely available

Reliable and stable

Suitable for both analog and digital applications

🧪 Simple Applications

Blinking LEDs

Servo motor control

IR transmitters or receivers

PWM motor controllers

Sound generation (buzzers)

🔷 555 Timer Operating Modes

1. Monostable Mode (One-Shot Mode)

📌 When to Use:
When a time delay is needed

When you want to perform a single operation upon a trigger (e.g., press a button, perform an action briefly)

For pulse generation applications

🛠️ Applications:

Application	Description

Doorbell	LED/sound stays active for a short time when pressed
Button debouncing	Filters unwanted noise from mechanical buttons
Relay activation timer	Keeps a relay on for a defined period
Camera flash control	Produces a single flash when triggered

🎯 Summary:
Trigger ➝ Output goes HIGH for a fixed time ➝ Then returns to LOW automatically

2. Astable Mode (Free-Running Mode)
📌 When to Use:
When continuous signal generation is needed

For generating PWM, square waves, or blinking effects

When acting as a tone or clock generator

🛠️ Applications:

Application	Description

LED blinking circuit	LED blinks at regular intervals
Square wave oscillator	Frequency generation
Sound generator (buzzer)	Produces tone at fixed frequency
PWM motor control	Controls motor speed using variable duty cycles

🎯 Summary:
Automatically generates a continuous HIGH ↔ LOW waveform
No external triggering is required

3. Bistable Mode (Flip-Flop Mode)

📌 When to Use:

When a toggle ON/OFF logic is needed

When you need manual switching between two stable states

To maintain a state based on input (like memory elements)

🛠️ Applications:

Application	Description

Digital switch	First button turns it ON, second turns it OFF
Memory latch	Remembers state after an event
Toggle circuit	LED toggles its state with each button press

🎯 Summary:

Triggered with TRIG ➝ Output goes HIGH
Reset with RESET ➝ Output returns to LOW
Does not change state automatically

🎛️ Mode Comparison Table:

Feature	Monostable	Astable	Bistable

Trigger Required	✅ Yes	❌ No	✅ Yes

Output Duration	⏲️ Fixed duration	♾️ Continuous	🧭 Stable

State Change	After timeout	Repeats automatically	On button press

Use Case	Timer, delay	Oscillator, PWM	Flip-flop, toggle
